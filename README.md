# YouTube Video Analysis Project

This project is focused on analyzing YouTube video data to extract insights such as the most popular videos, common words in titles, category-wise analysis, and trends over time. It utilizes Python libraries like pandas, sklearn, and json to process and analyze data from CSV and JSON files.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Pandas library
- Sklearn library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/walikhawaja01/NeuralNetworksApp.git>
    ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository.

    ```bash
    cd NeuralNetworksApp
    ```

3. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

4. Install the required Python libraries.

    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn
    ```

### Data Files

Place your `.csv` and `.json` data files in the `models` directory. The script will automatically process files from this directory.

## Usage
